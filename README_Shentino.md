Caveats
-------

Everything I already emailed ShannonA before

The login process in Merry may still be gimped due to inexperience with
keycode handling.  more LPC side study required.

I noticed evidence of apparent skotos server side port redirections
involving code not present in the gables instance itself.  please be wary
of this for a standalone release, and pay particular attention to port
numbers in skotos.dgd

I did my best to remove any proprietary stuff (like third party
copyrighted stuff, i.e. ironclaw and lovecraft for example), and I took
some care to scour for confidential information (passwords, NDA protected
chatlogs, etc), but you might want to have a skotoslib engineer double
check things just in case I missed anything.
