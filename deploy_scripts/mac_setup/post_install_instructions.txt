To log in as a developer: telnet localhost 10098

To create a new chat character: point your browser at http://localhost:10080/SAM/Prop/Theatre:Web:Theatre/Index

To log in directly when you already have a character: point your web browser at http://localhost:10080/gables/gables.htm?charName=ignored

By default, the setup script gave you an admin user with password "adminpwd" and a user named "bobo" with password "bobopwd". You can change these...

After the first (very long) time you run SkotOS, it should create a state file in the container. Later boot-ups should be much faster unless you delete the statefile.

See https://ChatTheatre.github.io/SkotOS-Doc/setup.html for more details on the setup.

SkotOS's builder interface:
