=========================================

To log in on the highly insecure dev interface (note: keep it behind a firewall, please!):
http://localhost:2072/

To log in via telnet on the lowest-level developer interface: telnet localhost 11098

Note that when using this dev interface, *any password will be accepted*. The production
UserDB server does it reasonably, but it's a pain to set up locally. See the Linode
stackscripts for details of the right way to do it.

After the first (very long) time you boot SkotOS, it should create a state file in the container. Later boot-ups should be much faster unless you delete the statefile. Note: statefile management is a bit complicated - make sure to read some docs about it or you won't understand why stuff isn't updating.

See https://ChatTheatre.github.io/SkotOS-Doc/setup.html for more details on the setup.
