# Creating and Pushing a Docker image to Docker Hub

To build an image from Dockerfile, use the build script, or directly build:

    docker build --no-cache -t noahgibbs/skotos .

You'll also need to log in:

    docker login --username=noahgibbs

You should then be able to push to Docker Hub:

   docker push noahgibbs/skotos

Pushing will take significant time and a lot of bandwidth.
