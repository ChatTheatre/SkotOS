Command processing
==================

Hopefully good notes on how commands are parsed:

TextIF builtins
---------------

There are several commands built into TextIF.

* Host commands

Hard coded and prefixed by a +, these are available only to storyhosts

* cmd_<verb>

I found these in the handlers in TextIF, and the central handler uses
function_object to check for these.
