=========================================

To log in as a developer: telnet localhost 10098

To create a new chat character: point your browser at http://localhost:10080/SAM/Prop/Theatre:Web:Theatre/Index

To log in directly when you already have a character: point your web browser at http://localhost:10900/gables/gables.htm

By default, the setup script gave you an admin user with password "adminpwd" and a user named "bobo" with password "bobopwd". You can change these...

You will need to type your character name into the pop-up and then *again* into the browser terminal. Sorry :-(

After the first (very long) time you run SkotOS, it should create a state file in the container. Later boot-ups should be much faster unless the whole Docker container is destroyed.

See https://ChatTheatre.github.io/SkotOS-Doc/setup.html for more details on the setup.

In some terminal programs, this script just opened a bunch of terminal tabs like the DGD error log. If you can't find the terminal you ran this from, it's probably hidden by new tabs.

### Untested and Upcoming
