To log in as a developer: telnet localhost 10098

By default, the setup script gave you an admin user with password "adminpwd" and a user named "bobo" with password "bobopwd". You can change these...

See https://ChatTheatre.github.io/SkotOS-Doc/setup.html for more details on the setup.

In some terminal programs, this script just opened a bunch of terminal tabs like the DGD error log. If you can't find the terminal you ran this from, it's probably hidden by new tabs.
