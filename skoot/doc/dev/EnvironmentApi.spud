We need to be able to refer to physical objects in the virtual world
that are not represented by explicit DGD object instances. Example:

	You're in a street. There's a crowd of mercenaries here.
	> look at mercenaries
	There's six of them, rough-looking and expensively equipped.
	> attack one of the mercenaries
	You engage one of the mercenaries in combat...

For the command parser to be able to handle this equally well for
explicit and implicit objects, we need to specify the API's quite
carefully. We need to be able to -locate- 'mercenaries' in the
environment, to -describe- the mercenaries as a group once found,
to -count- them, and also somehow handle them on a one-by-one
basis, at which point they must probably be -instantiated-.

Currently, an environment is queried for contents through:

	object *query_inventory();
	object single_match(string name);
	object *plural_match(string name);
	object *present(string name);

Once found, the objects returned need to respond to at the very least:

	string query_article();
	string query_description();


The simplest solution seems to be to generalize environment support
for locating and describing groups, and as soon as a single object
really needs to be returned, we have to instantiate it.
