Status update on 990427, since 990402
=====================================


 ** Milestone: Successful object creation and editing through HTTP.


 ** News:

  - Spliced a chunk of ~System off that didn't belong there, mixed it
    with the former ~Text directory, and created ~SkotOS. Renamed the
    directory /world to /base. This leaves us with a coarse directory
    structure of:


	/kernel
	  Dworkin's kernel library, unmodified.

	/usr/System
	  Code with special permission to access /kernel and special
	  abilities to enforce restrictions on all code outside of
	  /kernel and ~System. Holds holds the program database, the
	  error-logging functionality, enforces creation/destruction
	  consistency and clone registration/count... also currently
	  provides global HTTP access -- which may move to ~SkotOS.

	  Code in ~System relies on /kernel, calls ~SkotOS, but has
	  no knowledge of anything else, especially not /base.

	/base
	  Contains the core classes that define an object as being
	  in-world and which defines the physical simulation of the
	  world. There have been no major modifications here.

	/usr/SkotOS
	  Interfaces upwards with ~System, downwards with /base, and
	  sideways with the logged-on players. From the player point
	  of view, SkotOS is the core of the system, running under
	  ~System and providing human-consumable interfaces to the raw
	  world objects.


  - Completely rewrote the SPUD language for intermingling server data
    with static HTML. Added HTTP authentication. Wrote the first simple
    but functional pages for creation and modification of world objects.
    SPUD should be able to generate both HTML and text, and we should
    be able to write all our documentation in it as well as the dynamic
    web pages.

  - Text player interface made the transition from debug-message-ridden
    prototype to presentable and (hopefully) error-safe.

  - Major cleanups in preparation for CVS import.


 ** Deadline for Friday the 30th, with stated goals "functional game
    interface and functional web editing". Things left to do: Let the
    player select an actual name instead of "Citizen A", add all the
    entries relevant to /base/lib/thing.c and add support for room.c
