Things such as cakes or pies, which can be sliced up into pieces. Sliceable food is edible as is, which leaves room to make any kind of food "sliceable". For a food item to be sliceable, the special property export:sys:shared:consumable:slices-into must point to the object into which the food is sliced. The number of slices into which a piece of food item can turn into is defined by a comparison of, in the case of a cake, the mass of the cake versus the mass of the slice. Whenever a slice of cake is taken out of the cake, the mass of the slice is subtracted from the remaining mass of the cake. If the cake mass "rougly" becomes that of a slice, the cake itself turns into a slice of cake.
~
Worth noting is that foods of this type cannot be liquid. It may seem obvious, but one might expect a pot of stew to be distributable via "slicing" it, but the liquid system will handle this fine, without special slice-code.
