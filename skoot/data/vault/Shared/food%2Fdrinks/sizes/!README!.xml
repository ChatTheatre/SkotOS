This folder contains a bunch of objects which may seem like they have odd names. These objects are in fact here to help
you set the size for a food item, or a vessel (in which drinks or "liquid" food are placed), so that it doesn't take
people 500 years to finish eating the whole thing.

The following "types" of objects currently exist:
* BITES (Bite, Bites2, Bites3, Bites4) -- The bites are used for food items that are NOT LIQUID, such as bagels or
  burgers or whatever else people can hold in their hands without using a plate.

* GULPS (Gulp, Gulps2, Gulps3, Gulps4) -- The gulps are used for VESSELS -- NOT LIQUIDS BECAUSE LIQUIDS HAVE NO SIZE
  -- to define how many gulps (e.g. drink my ale) it takes to drink the entirety of that vessel.

* NIBBLES (Nibble, Nibbles2, Nibbles3) -- The nibbles are like the bites, but fractions. The "smaller" eat actions
  (e.g. nibble) are used as the reference here. Nibbles2 means one has to nibble the item twice to eat it completely.

* SIPS (Sip, Sips2, Sips3) -- Same as nibbles, but for vessels -- again, this is for vessels not for liquids.
