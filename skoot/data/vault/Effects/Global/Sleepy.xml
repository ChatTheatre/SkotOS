           Sleepy effect. To add this effect on an object, add the Call() line below to the appropriate Merry reaction(s):
$["";/*
  Call(${Effects:Global:Sleepy}, "apply", $who: $actor, $severity: 1);
*/]
The $(severity) argument decides how strong the effect is. If you wish to make extra strong sleep effects, up the severity to e.g. 2.
