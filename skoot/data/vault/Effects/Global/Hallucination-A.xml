           The Hallucination-A effect is for use in the Owl induction ceremonies, due to its very owl-themed hallucinations. It should encourage the role-player to react to phantasmagorical images of wings, sounds, and horrifying images of owls.
To add this effect to any merry script, add the Call() line below to the reaction(s):
$["";/*
  Call(${Effects:Global:Hallucination-A}, "apply", $who: $actor, $severity: 1);
*/]
The $(severity) argument decides how strong the effect is. 0-4 = unaffected, 5-8 = loose, 9-12 = uninhibited, 13+ = hallucinating. Thus, the default is "drink 4 times to become tipsy, 8 times to become drunk, etc." If you wish to make extra strong Hallucination-A effects, up the severity to e.g. 2.
