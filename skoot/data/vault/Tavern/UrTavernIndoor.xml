             the eastern wall
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine-bright">
             The close-studded, half-timbered eastern wall is constructed of dark, unpainted oak posts (the studs) and a few diagonal arch-braces, joined with mortises and pegs, and all somewhat less than perfectly flat and square. Few of the studs are of the same width, and some have slight curves or uneven surfaces. The arch-braces rise from some of the larger posts, and curve slightly 'inward' as they rise to support the ceiling beams. Between the wooden posts and braces are panels of rough, whitewashed plaster, laid over laths or wattle-work covered with clay mixed with horse-hair. These panels are recessed about half an inch beyond the surrounding wooden framing. The wall is about eight feet high.
