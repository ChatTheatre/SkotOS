         "ABOUT ENGRAVING\<br/\>\<br/\>Before even writing, there was engraving. Primitive peoples incised their earliest writings on stone and clay; long before the invention of pen and ink, the etching of knowledge on durable materials allowed the decoration of items, and the transmission of information. Engravers can apply symbols and decorations to most common metal objects, including most types of jewelry and weapons. Over seventy unique symbols are known to the castle's engravers currently; as an engraver's skill grows, he or she will be able to correctly depict more and more of these symbols."
