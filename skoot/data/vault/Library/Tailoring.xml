         "A NOTE TO THE READER\<br/\>\<br/\>When man first thought himself different from the beasts, he clad himself in rude coverings; and thus is tailoring the oldest of the human crafts. While any might through rude hides and long-twined leaves over their naked selves, it is by the agency of tailoring that man and women are better clad, and their betters clad the best of all. Tailors possess the skill, instinct and learning required to create, alter and change to custom the many common types of clothing found in the Castle, including shirts, pants, dresses, blouses, and gowns.\<br/\>\<br/\>Not all clothing items will succumb to the scissors of a tailor. Shoes, boots and other footwear require the skills of a cobbler. Gloves and handwear are the province of a glover, while hats and headwear are the speciality of the hatter. An experienced dyer is required to change the color of an item; and the application of custom symbols requires the services of an embroiderer. Many tailors will learn several of these ancillary skills as well as their basic, primal trade.\<br/\>\<br/\>Tailors should in all cases be aware of the sumptuary prohibitions expressed in the Capitulary, regarding the prohibitions on certain fabrics. While the penalty of these misdemeanors will fall upon the wearers, it is no doubt true that Her Majesty's ministers will be displeased with any tailor foolish enough to provide the garb that fit the criminal."

Over thirty different fabrics are available in the Castle, some rare and some difficult to employ.

The more the clothing fits, the better the quality of the relationship between a clothing item and its wearer.
