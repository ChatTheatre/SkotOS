       <br/>Title: Bulk<br/> Important Commands: drop, get<br/><br/> Objects have weight, size, and bulk. These physical measures limit how many objects can be carried, how many objects can be put in a container, and which objects can fit into which rooms. These physical limitations are all implemented by the bulk system. <br/> There are currently no commands that directly interact with bulk. If you're trying to carry too much, the system will tell you so. By dropping the largest, bulkiest objects, you'll be able to pick up more. Likewise, you might be told if a certain object won't fit into a container or through a door.<br/><br/> See Also: Manipulation<br/>
