       COMMAND USAGE: !grab [character]<br/> EXAMPLE: !grab Launfal<br/><br/> Teleports a character to your current location, which should typically be the Skotos Office or some other official place. This should only be done with a character's permission or in an extreme case and should be considered more disruptive than simply talking to a character via pages. After you have finished talking to a character you can return them to their previous locale with the !ungrab command.<br/><br/> SEE ALSO: !join, !office, !page, !ungrab
