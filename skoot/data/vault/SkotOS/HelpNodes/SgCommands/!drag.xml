       COMMAND USAGE: !drag [character]<br/> EXAMPLE: !drag Retribution<br/><br/> The drag command lets you restrain a character so they can't leave their current room, then brings then along with you when you walk away. In order to stop dragging someone, instead "!drag nobody" or drag a different person. (You can only drag one person a time.)<br/> Dragging someone off to a private place to talk is the primary use of this command, through the !grab command is probably less intrusive to the roleplaying of other characters.<br/><br/> SEE ALSO: !grab, !ungrab
