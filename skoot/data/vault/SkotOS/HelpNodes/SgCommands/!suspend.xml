       COMMAND USAGE: !suspend [option] [user] ; !suspend [option] [user] "[reason]"<br/> EXAMPLE: !suspend add joeblow "He keeps creating new characters and being abusive" ; !suspend remove joeblow ; !suspend status joeblow<br/><br/> If no other disciplinary method works you may choose to suspend a user's account. You will need to use the !finger command to get their account name. This should only be done if talking with the user does not work and if either !dismissing or !muting them only resulted in them creating new and abusive characters.<br/><br/> SEE ALSO: !dismiss, !finger, !mute
