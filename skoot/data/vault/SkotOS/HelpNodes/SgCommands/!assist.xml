       COMMAND USAGE: !assist [option]<br/> EXAMPLE: !assist 1, !assist close "I told this player where to find people", !assist alert<br/><br/> The !assist command gives you access to a variety of functionality related to help other players out. The most commonly used commands are "!assist alert", which toggles on and off whether you see new assists as they come in and "!assist" which lists the most common commands and also the questions currently sitting in the assist queue.<br/> If you see an assist that you want to take, you can take it off the queue by typing "!assist [#]", i.e. "!assist 1". Once you've done this you'll typically !page the player. If you later decide you have to join the player, and have their permission to do so, you can easilly to so with "!assist join".<br/> Once you're done with an assist, you can close it by typing: !assist close "[message]", where the message should say something useful about how the request was resolving.<br/> You can contact other people currently taking assists via the assist line. Type "!assist who" to see who's listening in and !assist "[message]" to send them all a message.<br/> Though you may listen to assists while in any body, you should only respond to assists as a StoryGuide. Note also that you see assists from all games, but currently cross-game paging is not enabled. Thus if you decide to help someone in a different game you will have to explicitly log in to that game.<br/><br/> SEE ALSO: !page
