       <br/>Title: Health<br/> {? equal | $(theatre.gameid) | Marrach | Important Commands: duel, health, rest<br/><br/> Currently the Castle is a pretty safe place--except for the occasional duel. Dueling can be a dangerous thing. When you're in a duel, if you're getting the worst of it (which you can see with the "health" command), you can try to "rest", but beware--your opponent may take advantage of this lapse.<br/> Repeated duels with sharpened weapons can result in death, so be careful about entering a new duel if you're already injured, else you may be returning to the Necromancer's caverns.<br/><br/> See Also: Combat, Death<br/> | {? equal | $(theatre.gameid) | GES | <br/>Currently, you cannot be injured in Galactic Emperor: Succession unless the Vl'Hurgh invasion is successful and the entire Empire is destroyed.<br/> Try and avoid that posssibility.<br/> | <br/>There is little possibility for injury in Chat Theatres. Have fun! } }
