       Title: Dismiss<br/><br/>StoryGuides have the ability to send players to the Oubliette if they are being disruptive to the game. This is intended to be a merely temporary measure until an understanding can be reached which does not destroy everyone's enjoyment of the game.<br/>Characters sent to the Oubliette are trapped and will not be able to leave.<br/>(The Oubliette is intended solely for out-of-character (OOC) problems. In-character (IC) problems are dealth with by the Watchmen and guards and characters might be sent to the Dungeons for a few days.)<br/>You may appeal a StoryGuide action by mailing ce@skotos.net.
