       Title: Friends (pending)<br/> Important Commands: none yet<br/><br/> Castle Marrach will eventually contain friend lists, so that you can get a list of where your friends are online (provided that they're in public places).<br/> When multiple games become available at Skotos, this functionality will be generalized, so that you can see which games your friends are logged in to.<br/> These features have not yet been implemented, but are expected in the future.<br/><br/> See Also: Custom<br/>
