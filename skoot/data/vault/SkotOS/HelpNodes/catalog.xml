       Title: Catalog<br/>Important Commands: Catalog<br/><br/>
Description: All the catalogs in Castle Marrach have gone virtual! This means that you can no longer point at your catalog to have items poof into existance. Everything is now done via the 'catalog' command.<br/><br/>Why you might ask? Well, first off, all catalogs are OOC props to help facilitate roleplay and so having an item that can be interacted with, pointed at, stolen, lost, given away, etc. defeats the purpose of it being OOC. Second, maintaining catalogs is no easy task and so this system means that maintanence shall be a very quick process, and that is good.<br/><br/>What does this all mean for you? Well, it means that you simply have to remember a few commands and no longer have to worry about misplacing your catalog. Those commands are as follows:<br/><br/>
\> catalog<br/>
catalog - This help<br/>
catalog 'list - Lists available catalogs<br/>
catalog 'list (catalog) - Contents of specific catalog<br/>catalog 'create (catalog) (item #) - Creates a copy of that item in your inventory<br/><br/>
Examples:<br/>
\> catalog 'list<br/>
--[ Virtual Catalog ]------------------------[ v1.0 ]------------<br/>
Awakener - A Plain Awakener Catalog<br/>
Weapons - A Plain Weapons Catalog<br/><br/>
\> catalog 'list awakener<br/>
--[ Virtual Catalog ]------------------------[ v1.0 ]------------<br/>
1. a plain belt<br/>
2. a plain bodice<br/><br/>
\> catalog 'create awakener 1<br/>
You gesture and a plain belt solidifies in your hands.<br/><br/>If you believe you should have access to a catalog and do not or if you have any problems with the catalog system, please page StoryCoder Aziel.<br/>
