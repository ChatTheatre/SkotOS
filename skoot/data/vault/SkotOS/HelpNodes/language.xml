       <br/>Title: Languages<br/> Important Commands: @study, @speak<br/> Syntax: "@speak", "@speak [language]"<br/><br/> As you journey through the halls of Castle Marrach you'll find that some inhabitants of the Castle speak foreign languages. If you wish to take the time and learn a new language (or two) it can be done, but it requires patience in order to accomplish fluency.<br/> There are several languages in Castle Marrach: Some of these are Northern, Eastern, Western, and Common.<br/> Common is the language almost everyone speaks and knows. To learn other languages, find someone fluent and ask their assistance to help you learn. You may wish to look to some of your peers as possible mentors. Type "@study [language] with [person]" to undertake your education. Be patient; if someone only has the time to teach you a little bit about a language, you should thank them and bide your time.<br/> To find out what languages you currently speak (and how well), type "@speak".<br/> To communicate in a different language, type "@speak [language]". Thereafter anything you communicate will be said in that particular language, to the best of your ability. Type "@speak common" to return to normal speech.<br/><br/> See also: Accents, Communicate<br/>
