       <br/>Title: Skills<br/> Important Commands: assess, study, teach<br/><br/> Skills are abilities that your character possesses. Just like in real life you might be particularly skilled in fencing or in sewing or in speaking foreign languages.<br/> {? equal | $(theatre.gameid) | Marrach | To see the skills your character knows, type the $(udat.chatchar)SKILLS command. You can learn from teachers with the $(udat.chatchar)STUDY command: $(udat.chatchar)STUDY [SKILL] WITH [TEACHER]. If you gain the "Teach" skill, learnable from numerous tomes in Castle Marrach, you can also pass on your skills to others: $(udat.chatchar)TEACH [SKILL] TO [STUDENT].<br/> All skills are ranked from level 1 (Novice) to Level 10 (Grandmaster). A more complete explanation is available in the Player's Guide on the web site at: http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach/guide.shtml.<br/> | Although a skill system is a part of some Skotos Chat Theatres and games, it is not incorporated into $(theatre.gamebrief). } <br/><br/> See Also: Combat, Language<br/>
