       <br/>Title: Memory<br/> Important Commands: forget, recall, remember<br/><br/> Your character can remember things. This helps to make sure that you have all in-game information at your fingertips whenever you play--without having scattered scraps of papers and notes sitting on your desktop.<br/> To make a permanent note of something, use the $(udat.chatchar)REMEMBER command with the information you want to remember in quotes: $(udat.chatchar)REMEMBER "The poet made fun of me in a poem".<br/> To recall something you've remembered, type $(udat.chatchar)RECALL [PHRASE]", where the phrase should be a word or a set of quoted words that appear in the memory: $(udat.chatchar)RECALL Poet or $(udat.chatchar)RECALL "The Poet". If you recall a number of memories, they will currently show up in the order that they were memorized.<br/> You might find it helpful to use a specific format for your memories, such as "Quest: Find the Queen's handkerchief" or "People: Poet: Made fun of me". This way you can recall your keywords (like "Quest" or "People" or "Poet"), and know you're accessing all of the information on that topic.<br/> You can forget memories by typing $(udat.chatchar)FORGET [PHRASE], where the phrase should be a word or a set of quoted words. You'll forget all memories that include that word or words.<br/>
