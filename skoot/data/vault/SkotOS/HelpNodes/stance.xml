       <br/>Title: Stance<br/> Important Commands: crouch, kneel, lie, sit, stand<br/><br/> Rooms are full of things you can interact with. Some are permanent details, like hearths, altars, and tables. Others are movable objects, like swords, bags, and harps. You can assume continuing physical positions which are related to these details or objects; these are stances. They show what you are doing in a room and also tell other players about your current mental or physical state.<br/> Some common stance-related commands are: $(udat.chatchar)SIT ($(udat.chatchar)SIT AT ROUND TABLE, $(udat.chatchar)SIT UNDER TRESTLE TABLE), $(udat.chatchar)LIE ($(udat.chatchar)LIE NEAR HEARTH), $(udat.chatchar)KNEEL ($(udat.chatchar)KNEEL BEFORE ALTAR), $(udat.chatchar)CROUCH ($(udat.chatchar)CHROUCH BENEATH LONG TABLE), and $(udat.chatchar)STAND ($(udat.chatchar)STAND ON PLATFORM).<br/> Stances last until you break them-- either by moving around or by assuming a new stance (or pose).<br/> Poses are similar to stances; poses are also continuing physical positions, but they are not related to details or objects in a room.<br/><br/> See Also: Pose, Proximity<br/>
