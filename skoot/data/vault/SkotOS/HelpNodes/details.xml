       <br/>Title: Details<br/> Important Commands: look, examine<br/><br/> Rooms, people, and things all have details. These are integral (but distinct) elements of the object as a whole. For a room, details could include walls, a ceiling, a fireplace, built-in shelves, and a skylight. For a person, details could include arms, legs, a head, eyes, a nose, and ears. For a sword, details could include the hilt, the guard, and the weird runic words inscribed along the blade.<br/> Some objects will be highly detailed, while other will be lightly detailed--depending on how big the object is and how important it is.<br/> When you $(udat.chatchar)LOOK AT [AN OBJECT] you will see some of the important details of that object. When you $(udat.chatchar)EXAMINE [AN OBJECT] you'll see lots more--but beware, examining takes time and can be seen by other nearby people.<br/> Some details will have details, ad infinitum. When you examine a room, you might see a fireplace, and then you when you examine the fireplace you might see red bricks, and then you when you examine the bricks, you might see a discolored brick with a strangely straight crack, and then when you examine the crack, you might find a key inside.<br/> You get the idea: by examining the details of an object, you discover a whole virtual world.<br/><br/> See Also: Perception<br/>
