       <br/>Title: Help File Basics<br/> Important Commmands: help<br/> Syntax: "help", "help [subject]"<br/><br/> To help you learn how to get around $(theatre.gamebrief), we have created a set of help files that you may access and use at your own pace. In order to read a help file, just type, $(udat.chatchar)HELP [TOPIC]. <br/> Some of the first topics you may wish to become familiar with are: communication, emotion, manipulation, movement, roleplaying, theme, and fun. There are many other help files that will allow you to better understand Skotos Theatres and games, but the listed files cover the basics and are among the most useful for novices. <br/> To see a list of the most common commands, type $(udat.chatchar)HELP PLAYERS.<br/> To view a listing of all general concept files type, $(udat.chatchar)HELP CONCEPTS.<br/><br/> See Also: concepts
