       Title: Accent (pending system)<br/> Important Commands: accent<br/><br/> People talk in different ways. The Castle Marrach accent system models this. When you turn on an accent the StoryBuilder Server automatically adjusts your speech to use words more appropriate for the accent that you've chosen.<br/> For example, the Castle Marrach Terrino accent sounds like Old English: "you" becomes "thou"; "your" becomes "thy"; and "has" becomes "hath".<br/> The "accent" command is used to turn accents on and off. However, the system is still under construction, and so "accent" is not yet available. It will be available some time after the initial launch.<br/><br/> See Also: Communicate, Language<br/>
