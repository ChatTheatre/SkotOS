       <br/>Title: CNPCs<br/> Important Commands: ask<br/><br/> Computer Non- Player Characters (CNPCs) do many of the basic tasks in Skotos Tech's Theatres and games. They keep order, make sure that food and clothing are available, and respond to specific requests.<br/> CNPCs are relatively dumb. In general, you won't be able to actually converse with them, but they will respond to certain actions. In addition, you can often learn what items a CNPC can give you by typing $(udat.chatchar)ASK.<br/> The standard syntax is $(udat.chatchar)ASK [CNPC NAME]. For example, to learn what items a cook has available, visit with him and type $(udat.chatchar)ASK COOK. To ask for a specific item, type $(udat.chatchar)ASK [CNPC] FOR [ITEM], i.e. $(udat.chatchar)ASK COOK FOR CHEESE.<br/> Many CNPCs will produce items even when players are not around. For example, a cook might produce food while players are absent and place it on a nearby sideboard.<br/> {? equal | $(theatre.gameid) | Marrach |CNPCs in Castle Marrach include couriers, guards, seamstresses, and tailors. Most of these servants speak a strange foreign tongue that few guests understand.|Different Chat Theatres and games include different CNPCs.}<br/> See Also: Courier, Guard, Seamstress, Tailor, Eating<br/>
