You take the next plate in one hand, a brush in the other, and hum to yourself as the warm water runs over your hands when you scrub. (list1)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(2) 'Hush  hush  o pretty one, sleep...' how small the child is, how soft and defenseless, listening to your song. The baby's eyes flutter, half-closed, dark in the sunset light of the nursery. You brush the child's cheek with one finger, filled with affection for the tiny thing. 'O my baby, pretty one, sleep....' (list1)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(3) Salt and skin, low eager laughter and a sudden sharp gasp of indrawn breath at the caress of tongue and hands. Everything about your beloved is a wonder, a mystery; to feel the other tremble in your arms, cry out and shudder in explosions of joy is a hymn and a prayer fulfilled. You hold each other close, mingling sweat and dreams, kisses and hot scented breaths, limbs entwined. Let the moment be forever, you pray. My love is eternal; we shall never be apart. Never. (list1)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(1) You wipe up the last of the spill, folding the cloth neatly over the mess, thinking -- as you have thought before -- that the amount of waste babies can produce is amazing, considering their size.... (list1)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(1) Tiles are cool to your hands, but hard on your knees. You scrub, and scrub again, washing the last hint of muddy footprints from the flagstones in the hall. (list1)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(2) 'Ready -- now -- Heave!' The wagon creaks as the heavy boxes are lifted aboard. You drag and scrape the crates into. (list1)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(2) The mare stands solidly in the paddock, unmoving, as you stroke her flanks, save for the occasional flick of one ear at an intrusive fly. Her flesh is warm and firm beneath your hands, and the brush raises a fine faint cloud of dust which settles on your arms and tickles your nose. (list1)"/>

      <StartStory:Description desc="(1) The earth is dry and crumbly in your hands, but the plants are green and lush all around you, roots deep into the moisture far underground. You tug at the weeds that have also sprung up, enjoying the feel of the tug and release as each stalk yields to your gloved grasp. It is an endless struggle, but a battle that you enjoy. (list1)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(4) Bounty on all sides. Steam rising from platters, vegetables and bread laid out on either side. A feast for the eyes as well as the palate -- and all around you your family and friends, gathered close, eye the table with eagerness of their own. It is a grand feast -- but it will not last for long. (list1)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(5) the Mate's voice is clear over the creak of the rigging. 'Starboard loose! Portside heave! Handsomely boys, haul away...' You strain at the line in your hands, callused palms tight around the rope's great rough fibers as you pull, and pull once more, watching the great sail swing, then go taut on the beam. The ship shudders and surges forward with sudden power as the Mate cries hold, and you tie the lines securely to their pins. (list11)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(2) Strange sweet smells float in the smoke from nearby godowns; the folk who pass are strange and dark and eye you mysteriously as you pass. Everything is different -- from the trees, to the language, to the color of the sea and sky -- and you wonder if there could ever be a place stranger and more beautiful... (list11)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(3) Another wave breaks across the ship, pouring over the starboard rail and sluicing past the cabin. You are grabbed by water as if by a giant hand -- only your deathlike grip on the safety line keeps you from being thrown overboard in an instant. Cursing and fearful, you pull yourself up the pitching deck toward the wheelhouse; you catch only glimpses of your crewmate at the wheel, clinging to it desperately to avoid the clutches of the sea. (list11)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(1) You carve another line, peel back a trace of wood in a graceful arch. 'Here y'are Joe,' you say, offering him the hand. 'You can wear this. See? A bit of paint, your women'll never know.' Joe is not comforted -- his anger and his pain is there for all to see, as well as they can see the bloody rage where his left hand once was -- but humor and a new hand are all that you can offer; nothing will being the old one back. (list11)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(2) 'Sails ho! Man the guns!' The Captain leaps on deck, shouting orders. You can see the other sail far to port, a galleass perhaps, but you cannot make out her flag. No matter, the Captain calls the shots -- he says to prepare to fire and board, so you get your knives and strap them on as your ship closes for the attack. (list11)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(4) Another wave breaks across the ship, pouring over the starboard rail and sluicing past the cabin. You are grabbed by water as if by a giant hand -- swept off the safety of the deck and into the sea's cold embrace. Help me! God! You cry once, before you fail -- the water burns your eyes and throat as you struggle to survive, water pouring into heaving lungs -- but your prayers are for nothing. You are fallen in the open sea, and you cannot swim. (list11)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(8) Seasick! My God! It has never been this bad. The world surges and roils within you, waves of sick nausea and bile pouring up your throat and out your nose and mouth as you crouch miserably at the rail. The passengers and crew laugh at you -- you, the mighty sailor -- but you are helpless to do more than moan, and foul yourself and the hull once more. (list11)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(4) Could it be? You climb upon a capstan, staring, wanting to be sure -- but then the lookout's cry rings out: 'Land! Land dead ahead!' It is true -- after weeks at sea -- land at last! You fall to your knees, heedless of the others, and begin to pray. (list11)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(3) The candles are lit, and it is time to leave. You do not want to go. Your heart is empty, broken, the world grey with the immensity of your loss. Mother! Mother! You cry -- the room blurs with tears -- but Mother's pale face does not change. She lies unmoving in the casket until the attendants come, pull closed the lid, and lock her away forever. (list1)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(2) Dust!  a curse upon it!  Why does it always hide in corners, instead of facing us in the open? You tease and wrest at it with your broom, bristles shivery across the stones...  but the dust does not answer and does not sweep away. (list1)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(5) The overseer's whip cracks; but she is not nearby. Nonetheless you shift your stance, wincing, and heave the next rock onto the pile. Your joints ache with every move, and the rocks are countless in number. Soon a day will come when you are too old for the work, and are no longer taken -- then there will be no food, or wood for the night's fire. (list12)"/>

      <StartStory:Description desc="(5) You mix the powders together, waiting for any hint of scent or movement, but this time nothing happens. You sigh, relieved, and pour the grey-white mixture into a deep-rimmed bowl. Placing it aside, to turn to the next task -- a bubbling flask of yellow-grey liquid which must be strained through ash -- and from there to the next, and the next, and the next.... It is nightfall before you are finished preparing your materials. When the moon rises,later, you know that another batch must be begun. (list10a)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(5) 'Eagon Gorruuuitae!' you shout, sweeping the glass wand over the paper. Nothing happens. 'Perdition,' you whisper, and try again. 'Eagon Gorruuuuitae!' Still nothing; the spell produces no effect. No brightly colored flames appear; no flames at all in fact. You wonder if perhaps you need to trill your 'r's still more, or step harder on the 'g's....

      <StartStory:Description desc="(5) Endless days are filled with careful repetition. When the Great Beast is summoned, you know there will be only one chance to speak its Name, and any mistake could be fatal.

You take a sighting on the snowy hood of Mount Calyx, and another on the Ruby Star, measure the time since sunset with your sand glass and the angle between the Wanderer and the Veil. All of it goes into your notebook, to be examined later at length, but already tonight you can tell that the Alignment has begun; soon it will be time for the Ending of the Age. (list10d)"/>

There deep inside, it sings, leaping and turning like laughter. You reach in to it, touch it with your senses -- and the world flares bounteous and strange, filled with unseen mystery and forces for change. A whisper, a motion of your hand, and 'Yes!' the candle cries to you, 'Yes!' and flame bursts forth in shimmering sheets of glory. (list10e)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="(2) This time there is no pretty candle to tame: The fire rears and howls, hungering for destruction. House after house is sucked into its maw -- now only yours is left at the avenue's end. You reach within for the song of Power, pour it out: The fire is slippery, liquid, but your Power gives you strength. The fire yields! You twist it in sheets and braids, fling it high overhead and flare it outward with a magnificent blossoming glare. All around you there are screams -- but the soul of the fire is within you; you can do no less than laugh with joy. (list10f)"/>

You strain at the line in your hands, callused palms tight around the rope's great rough fibers as you pull, and pull once more, watching the great sail swing, then go taut on the beam. The ship shudders and surges forward with sudden power as the Mate cries hold, and you tie the lines securely to their pins. (list11)"/>

You are grabbed by water as if by a giant hand -- only your deathlike grip on the safety line keeps you from being thrown overboard in an instant.

You are fallen in the open sea, and you cannot swim. (list11)"/>

      <StartStory:Description desc="second=(1) The sun blasts at your back, but you see no shade, only dazzling dunes rising as far as the eye can see.

How can you possibly live through another day of this?"/>

You feel for your dagger and your ring of poison, and find them right where they should be. The courtyard is quiet and still, and clouds cover most of the stars, but your eyes can pick put the doorways, just as they were described to you. (pickpocket)"/>

The enemy forces will have fresh reinforcements arriving tomorrow noon, while yours are still another day and a half away. What can you do, you wonder? Approaching your tent to get some well-deserved sleep, a note from the Crown lays on your table. With trembling fingers, you break the seal....(tactics)"/>
      <StartStory:Description desc="second=(2) You crush the ultimatum in your hand, mind red with rage. You have not spent eleven starveling weeks in this accursed keep to simply hand it over without assurances of safety! You throw the offending piece of paper back at the cringing herald.

Soon, too soon, will come the dawn, when the Beast will return for the third and final day of Its feasting.

You copy the texts, but all the while your eyes stray along the weaving lines, barely averted from impossible, blasphemous acts and sinful joys. Truly, the ancients who lovingly illuminated each scene were anything but holy; yet their passions and eagerness for life shone through, causing your hands to shiver and your mind to wander dangerously far from your god.(religiousclass)"/>
