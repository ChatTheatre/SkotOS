       <br/>Title: Chatmode<br/>
Important Commmands: /chatmode<br/>
Syntax: "/chatmode"<br/><br/>
You can regard a chat theatre in two ways -- as a place where you talk, or as a place where you express yourself. If you only want to talk and care less about things like smiling at people or "reacting", then chatmode is for you. In fact, chatmode is enabled by default, but you can turn it on or off by typing <acmd tag="command" cmd="/chatmode">/chatmode</acmd> at any time.<br/><br/>
When chatmode is enabled, you simply type text into the client and hit enter, and your character will say whatever you typed. If you wish to express yourself while in chatmode, such as grinning at somebody, then precede this expression with a slash sign (/), like so:<br/>
/grin at lucy<br/><br/>
With chatmode disabled, you do not have to precede expressions with slash; however, when you want to say something, you have to -- at the very least -- wrap it in quotation marks, like so:<br/>
"Hi folks."<br/>
The system is forgiving in terms of the ending quotation. Thus,<br/>
"Hi folks.<br/>
will work just as well.<br/><br/>
