<h1 align="center">Getting Started</h1>
<DIV>Welcome to $(map.title) Chat Theatre! In $(map.title) you'll be able to
chat with others in a virtual environment described almost entirely
by text.

<P></P>You'll start out at a central room in $(map.title) which will be
represented by a textual description. Whenever people do things in your
surroundings, lines of text will scroll up the display describing what
is being
said and done. Likewise, when you say and do things, the other people in
the
room will "see" these actions. <if val="$(udat.chatmode)"><true>To talk to other people, simply type what you want to say at the command line: <font face="courier" color="#ff33ff">Hello, How are you?</font>. You'll be able to take other actions like smiling, laughing, or hugging, by typing in a command like $(udat.chatchar)SMILE, $(udat.chatchar)LAUGH or $(udat.chatchar)HUG. Remember to precede all of those actions with that "$(udat.chatchar)".</true><false>To talk to other people, use evocation verbs like $(udat.chatchar)SAY, $(udat.chatchar)TELL, or $(udat.chatchar)SHOUT: <font face="courier" color="#ff33ff">$(udat.chatchar)tell cat "I like cats."</font>. Many other verbs are available like $(udat.chatchar)SMILE, $(udat.chatchar)LAUGH, and $(udat.chatchar)HUG.</false></if> You don't need
to type pronouns like "I" and "you"; just instruct your alterego in what
he or
she should do.

<P></P>You can change how you input commands in $(map.title) with the "chatmode" command. Type $(udat.chatchar)CHATMODE in order to <if val="$(udat.chatmode)"><true>be able to type commands without the "$(udat.chatchar)". You will then have to use verbs like "say", "tell", or "shout" in order to say things to other players.</true><false>be able to type in words that other people see without having to use an evocation verb like "say", "tell", or "shout". You will then have to precede all verbs with a "/".</false></if>

<p></p><hr/>

<p></p>Once you've chatted a little bit with other players of $(map.title) you'll probably want to learn more about your environment and how to get around it.

<P></P><B>PERCEPTION.</B> When you enter a room, you'll get a very brief
description of the locale, but you'll often want to know more. To get a
medium
amount of information, type $(udat.chatchar)LOOK. To
get a high amount of information, type $(udat.chatchar)EXAMINE; note that examine takes
a few moments and can be seen by everyone in a room.

<P></P><B>MOVEMENT.</B> Chat Theatres come in many shapes and sizes.
Some consist of just a handful of rooms.  Others are larger.  You can
move between rooms through a variety of exits: gates, doors,
passageways, etc. You'll probably around be aware of exits from your "look"s, "examine"s, or from perusing the graphical map on the client. You can also type $(udat.chatchar)EXITS to get a definitive list of ways to get out of a room. You can use the $(udat.chatchar)GO
command to
move through exit: <font face="courier" color="#ff33ff">$(udat.chatchar)go north</font> or <font face="courier" color="#ff33ff">$(udat.chatchar)go wooden door</font>. Directions can also be
abbreviated, for example $(udat.chatchar)N, $(udat.chatchar)SE, or $(udat.chatchar)W.
Some exits may be $(udat.chatchar)UP or $(udat.chatchar)DOWN.

more information on communication and other topics.

<P></P><B>MORE INFORMATION.</B>
Standard tips are also available; type $(udat.chatchar)TIP. For help on a variety of topics, type $(udat.chatchar)HELP CONCEPTS.<br/>
