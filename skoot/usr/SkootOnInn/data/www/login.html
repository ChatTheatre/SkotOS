   Skoot is a virtual text-based chat environment. You create a new
   persona in Skoot World, and then issue commands that allow you to
   walk around and communicate with your virtual peers.
   <p>
   The first thing to do is to pick a name. For simplicity, choose a
   single word. You can enter a different name every time you visit
   the chat.
   <p>
   When you've picked a name, a persona is created for you and placed
   in the world. You will be told what your persona sees, including a
   list of other people in the room you're in. You can stay and chat
   there, or you can look at all the details in the room, or you can
   go explore other rooms.
   <p>
   Whenever people do things in your surroundings, lines of text will
   scroll up the display describbing what is being said and done.
   Likewise, when you say and do things, the other people in the room
   "see" what happens.
   <p>
   Once you're done chatting, you can leave the world simply by closing
   your browser window. The other people in the room you're in at the
   time will be told of your departure.
   <p>
   Welcome, and enjoy!
