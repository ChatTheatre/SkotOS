  You can control your virtual persona, explore and
  investigate the world and communicate with people. This is done
  by typing lines of text at the bottom of the browser window.
  <p>
  The lines typed are imperative statements (commands) like 'look',
  'go north', 'smile at the dog'. If the software understands what you are
  trying to do, it will cause your persona to do it: that is how you
  interact with the virtual environment.
  <p>
  To look around,
  <blockquote>
    &gt; <i>look</i><br>
    &gt; <i>look at lisa</i>
  </blockquote>
  To move around,
  <blockquote>
    &gt; <i>north</i><br>
    &gt; <i>go iron door</i>
  </blockquote>
  To socialize,
  <blockquote>
    &gt; <i>grin broadly</i><br>
    &gt; <i>nod to michael "I think this'll work."</i><br>
	&gt; <i>ask gifford "So, what is this anyway?"</i><br>
	&gt; <i>smile at evelyn "This is a good soup."</i>
  </blockquote>
  <b>Parts of speech</b> <P>
  Feel free to try things. You can use phrases that describe how you say something such as...
  <blockquote>
    &gt; <i>remark, comment, inquire, ask, state, imply, etc.</i><br></blockquote>
	You can also communicate with facial expression...
  <blockquote>
    &gt; <i>frown, sneer, smirk, smile, blink, etc.</i><br>
