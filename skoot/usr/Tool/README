Wishlist / TODO list:

*** Zell:
    +tool move <ob1> [in|on] <env1>
    It should use move() -- the silent version of act_teleport() basically.

*** Leah:
    Some way to set/change/query/erase details?

*** Jess:
    Something for crafting?
    Wildcards for the '+tool bilbo list %object <script>' script names.

*** Nino:
    Make it possible to create a new woe object, or rename them, etc.
    I suppose that renaming them is possible now that the Woe popup is
    a reality, but something like '+tool woe rename %object newname' might
    be useful still, as well as '+tool woe create newname %urparent'.

*** Christopher:
    Make it so that after a successful edit, the object is dumped as XML in
    SID's vault?

10:09 [LocalGame|Kargh] "You know what would be really nice Nino? Crafting. A
                         nice setup for it. Initial contents also but thats
                         not used quite as much."
10:12 [LocalGame|Kargh] "I have some ideas for crafting... A master list of 
                         tools and ingredients (that can be added to when
                         needed). So, if you want to make a craftable item,
                         you can select the ingredients from a huge list and 
                         what tools are needed and basically you are done."

10:10 [LocalGame|Christophera] "Alice is capable of forms, so it is 
                                theoretically possible for you to edit
                                woe-like stuff in Alice forms."
10:10 [LocalGame|Christophera] "At least Zell threatened trying to to at some 
                                point ;-)"
10:11 [LocalGame|Nino] "Sure, but I'd like to keep this as simple and generic 
                        as possible, so I don't want to make Alice-specific
                        things if I can help it."
10:11 [LocalGame|Nino] "Also, I can do any sort of pop-ups, so I can make HTML 
                        forms too, just as the editor is."
10:12 [LocalGame] "Christophera nods and says "Yes, I suspected as such -- if 
                   it happens it will be a Zell thing rather then a Nino
                   thing."
10:12 [LocalGame] "Nino grins."

Various things to list.
- users, grouped or sorted by ipnumber, room, payment status, and
  whatever else comes to mind.
- inventory, optionally of some other object/room.

BILBO support.
- renumber scripts, while trying to keep things sane.
- rename/remove scripts.

Merry support:
- list available scripts and where they are inherited from.
- list scripts
- rename/remove scripts.

SAM support.
- list available SAM tags, sorted by 'domain'.

Support for the logs.  Basically moving the +log command here and then
extending it.
