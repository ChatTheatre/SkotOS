# "SkotOS" Skotos Open Source Game Library

This is a pre-release version of the Skotos Open Source game library, aka "SkotOS", written for use with [Dworkin's Game Driver](https://github.com/dworkin/dgd), aka "DGD". It a fourth-generation text MUD engine that has been in devopment and active use for almost two decades by [Skotos Tech](http://www.skotos.net/) in a number of commercial web-centric prose online games, including [Castle Marrach](http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach/), [Ironclaw Online](http://www.skotos.net/games/ironclaw/), [Lovecraft Country](http://www.lovecraftcountry.com/comic/), and [The Lazurus Project](http://www.lazarus-project.net/). 

## Status

This version is very pre-release and unsupported — installation is difficult, documentation is minimal, and a new web client needs to be built. The main goal of this initial release was to remove proprietary game content and and personal information from the commercial version used in games offered by Skotos Tech.

We are seeking volunteers to take this code to the 1.0 level suitable for anyone to quickly install the game and create their own web-centric prose games.
